The blog for this project can be found here : http://www.paulvdiyblogs.net/2019/03/a-pretty-universal-battery-cell-tester.html

Aldo Bertuletti also build the instrument, and he made some interesting changes, most obviously a different display and an input system tyat allows you to use it without a PC.
His code, foto's and two video's can be found in the project I created for this version
